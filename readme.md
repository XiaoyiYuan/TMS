This is a project done by me and my teammate Abigail Devereaux who is from the economics department at George Mason University. The project looks at how micro-structures of communication network shows problem-solving efficiencies of small teams. The repository includes the original code implemented in NetLogo. If you are not familiar with the language, there's a screenshot below. If you download netlogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml), you can play with the model with different parameters. NetLogo has very intuitive interface to test parameters.

The model is also written in python, with an additional function for testing team efficiencies. The paper in the repository explains the heuristics, agent behaviors, and statistical analysis of the model result. Our project is presented in the 2016 International Congress on Agent Computing in the poster session. The poster is also included in the repository.
