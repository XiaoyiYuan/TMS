This is a project done by me and my teammate Abigail Devereaux who is from the economics department at George Mason University. The project looks at how micro-structures of communication network shows problem-solving efficiencies of small teams. The repository includes the original code implemented in NetLogo. If you are not familiar with the language, there's also a screenshot of the model in the repository. If you download netlogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml), you can then open the code and play with the model with different parameters. The model is also written in python, with an additional function for testing team efficiencies. The paper in the repository explains the heuristics, agent behaviors, and statistical analysis of the model result.
